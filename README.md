# Spring 2022 CS170 Project Skeleton (TeamMajulah)

## Solving

We've added out solutions at the solver skeleton at [`python/solve.py`](python/solve.py).
```bash
python3 solve.py case.in --solver=naive case.out
```
As per the original README, the following command is to run the solver on all cases and puts them
in the output directory. To use it, modify
[`python/solve_all.py`](python/solve_all.py) to use your solver function(s).
Then run

```
python3 python/solve_all.py inputs outputs
```

in the root directory.
